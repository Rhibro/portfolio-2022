                    I have been moving around for the past couple years, I’ve gone from Canada,
                    to Belgium, to Tanzania, and finally to Sweden. I feel I have now started a 
                    life in Malmo.
                </p>
                <p class="info">This summer (August 2022) I began my education at Sundsgården Folkhögskola 
                    studying Front-End Development. I am looking forward to starting on a new career path where
                    I may draw on my previous knowledge from theatre and merge that with my new knowledge of
                    front-end development.
                </p>
                <p class="info">I studied Theatre Performance at Humber College in Toronto, Canada. I’ve always loved 
                    studying and working in the arts. My education has helped me develop many skills such as working in 
                    big groups, taking on leadership roles, giving and receiving constructive criticism, and always
                    keeping the audience in consideration.
                </p>
                <p class="info">How does the stage design/blocking/lighting/sound/music affect their experience? It is easy
                    to get caught up in your own experience on stage and forget about the audience entirely. It’s 
                    important to have fun on stage, it’s also important to have a deep understanding of the play, but 
                    if you can’t communicate that to an audience then what’s the point? 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p class="info">My years in theatre have taught me how important it is to consider other people’s experiences. 
                    I’ve also learnt how to design purposefully. Everything on stage has a job no matter how small or 
                    unassuming i.e a vase or a carpet. Even the colours displayed have a purpose. Set design, lighting,
                    and staging are all about drawing the eye to where you want the focus to be. I find some of the best
                    set designs can be quite minimal with the focus being on the actors in space as opposed to crowded and 
                    cumbersome sets where the actors tend to get lost.
                </p>
                <p class="info">Within the theatre world you need to wear many hats. When you’re starting out you may need to be
                    an actor, writer, producer, advertiser, designer, choreographer etc. I’ve been a part of productions where I 
                    have had all those titles. It takes a lot of logistical gymnastics to get a play from paper to stage. 
                </p>
                <p class="info">Overall my experience in the arts has given me the skills to bring an idea into reality. I plan
                    to bring that knowledge into my new career path.

                        I love practicality when it comes to studying. Obviously there is a need for 
                        theoretical studies, but I prefer working with the mechanics directly. When reading 
                        about this course I became immediately interested since we will be involved in so many
