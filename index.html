                    <p class="info">My years in theatre have taught me how important it is to consider other people’s experiences. 
                        I’ve also learnt how to design purposefully. Everything on stage has a job no matter how small or 
                        unassuming i.e a vase or a carpet. Even the colours displayed have a purpose. Set design, lighting,
                        and staging are all about drawing the eye to where you want the focus to be. I find some of the best
                        set designs can be quite minimal with the focus being on the actors in space as opposed to crowded and 
                        cumbersome sets where the actors tend to get lost.
