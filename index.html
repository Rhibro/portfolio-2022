                    <p class="info">Born and raised in Toronto, Canada. I have adventured all over this wide world and have now found myself 
                        ready to settle in Malmö, Sweden. I will be coming to the end of my studies at Sundsgården Folkhögskola in Front-end 
                        Development mid-January 2023. My education has given me many tools such as the ability to create fully responsive web-pages, a 
                        keen eye for accessibility, and an in-depth fluency in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. My extensive background in Theatre 
                        and Specialty Coffee has allowed me to develop my skills in working with large groups, taking on leadership roles, while also 
                        giving and receiving constructive criticism. I look forward to working with a company where I am given new challenges everyday 
                        and a supportive work environment where we can learn from each other.

                        I love practicality when it comes to studying. Obviously there is a need for 
                        theoretical studies, but I prefer working with the mechanics directly. When reading 
                        about this course I became immediately interested since we will be involved in so many
